I build an app where users can share places(images and adress) with other users
one user can create multiple places 
one place belong to one user 
=> it is one to many reation
2 entity = user/ places
user will have name /email/password/image
places will have title/ descripton / adress / location/image

CRUD operations for 2 entity(place and user)
get one and all
post
delete 
update
